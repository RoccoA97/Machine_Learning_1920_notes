\chapter{Learning via uniform convergence}

In this Chapter we will develop a more general tool, namely the \emph{uniform convergence}, and apply it to show that any finite class is learnable in the agnostic PAC model with general loss functions, as long as the range loss function is bounded.





\section{Uniform convergence is sufficient for learnability}
